# C++ Team Software Plan Review

## What are your overall impressions about the C++ team's design?
    The C++ team's Software plan was well thought out and thorough. All classes are detailed and include
    the parameters necessary for the classes to work properly. It provides clear descriptions of the Inputs
    and outputs of the program. It also thoroughly analizes the requirments for the program. 

## What did you learn from the C++ team's UML Class Diagram?
    The C++ Team's UML showed me how each class is used and the methods they carry. It told me which of the variables
    were private and what they are used for in each class. It also showed very clearly how each class realates to 
    eachother. This also told me the type of all the variables.

## Did the class diagram help you understand/navigate the source code?
    The UML did help me to navigate the source code, it showed how each of the classes relate to eachother. I could
    learn the same thing from reading the documentation but the UML is much more clear and easier to follow.
    However; the UML did not give enough details for each class by themselves, it only tells me ehat I need to look at
    in the documentation.

## What did you learn from the C++ team's Software Development Plan?
    The software development plan taught me what each class and their methods are supposed to do.
    it also taught me what variables the Class needs to work properly. I also learned about the program requirements
    This also told me about testing, and the end goal of the program.
